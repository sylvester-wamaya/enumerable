<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 my_enumerable <a name="about-project"></a>

The my_enumerable module is designed to mimic a subset of methods found in Ruby's Enumerable module. It includes implementations for all?, any?, and filter methods, which provide similar functionality as their counterparts in Enumerable.

This project serves as a valuable learning opportunity to understand how to use modules in Ruby classes effectively and how to create custom functionality similar to built-in Ruby modules. Developers can use this project as a foundation for further exploration and experimentation with Ruby modules and custom data structures.

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- **Modular Code:** The project demonstrates the power of modules in Ruby by implementing the MyEnumerable module, which provides a subset of methods found in Ruby's Enumerable module. The MyList class includes the MyEnumerable module, allowing it to leverage the functionalities provided by the module. This modular approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns, making it easier to extend or modify the behavior of MyList without directly altering its core implementation.
- **Custom Iteration and Filtering:**  The MyList class utilizes the each method, which implements custom iteration to yield successive elements from the internal @list. Additionally, the MyEnumerable module implements all?, any?, and filter methods, offering custom functionalities similar to their counterparts in Ruby's Enumerable. These methods allow developers to perform operations like checking if all elements meet a certain condition (all?), verifying if any element satisfies a condition (any?), and filtering elements based on a given criteria (filter). The custom iteration and filtering capabilities provide developers with a deeper understanding of how these operations work under the hood and demonstrate how powerful abstractions can be built using Ruby modules.
