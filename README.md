<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 MORSE CODE DECODER <a name="about-project"></a>

The Morse Code Decoder is a Ruby-based program that allows users to convert Morse code input into its corresponding text representation. With a user-friendly interface, the program takes Morse code input and decodes it character by character, providing a seamless way to understand Morse code messages. Whether you're learning Morse code or simply curious about its hidden meanings, this project offers an efficient and intuitive decoding solution. Try it out and unravel the mysteries of Morse code with ease!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

-- Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Change to the directory where you want to store the project.
Clone the Morse Code Decoder repository from GitHub using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/morse-code-decoder.git
```

Step 2: Install Ruby

Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check by running:
```
ruby -v
```
If Ruby is not installed, download and install it from the official Ruby website (https://rubyinstaller.org/).

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

### Install

Change into the Morse Code Decoder project directory using the command:
```
cd morse-code-decoder
```

### Usage

To use the Morse Code Decoder, run the morse_code_decoder.rb script:
```
ruby morse_code_decoder.rb
```

-- The program will prompt you to enter the Morse code you want to decode.
-- Input the Morse code using dots (.) for short signals and dashes (-) for long signals, separated by spaces for characters and spaces between words

<!-- FUTURE FEATURES -->

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

> Describe 1 - 3 features you will add to the project.

- [ ] **[Sound feedback]:**
  One exciting future feature that could be added to the Morse Code Decoder is sound feedback. This feature would provide an audible representation of the Morse code input as it is being decoded. As the user enters Morse code dots and dashes, the program could play corresponding short and long beeps or tones, respectively.
